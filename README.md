## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- leaflet.js

### What I learned

- Usage of leaflet maps and geo location Api.
- DOM manipulation in Javascript.

### Continued development

I will continue development as i will provide a store for previously stored ip address or domain.


### Useful resources

- [Leaflet Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/) - This helped me for rendering the map. 
- [Leaflet Github page](https://github.com/Leaflet) - This is an issue section helped me fix a box on map re-rendering. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
